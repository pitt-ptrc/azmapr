The goal of azmapr is to access the Azure Maps API and tidy the results.

## Installation

You can install the development version of azmapr like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("pitt-ptrc/azmapr")
```

## Example

Given data frame with a column `address`, the main wrapper function `azm_geocode` has sane defaults. 

```{r example}
library(azmapr)

azm_geocode(cand)
```

The Azure Maps API limits you to 100 address batches. If you pass a more than 100, `azmapr` breaks it up into chunks and pauses briefly in between. Azure Maps supports async geocoding for larger batches, but `azmapr` hasn't figured that out yet.

```{r}
azm_geocode(cand, test_batch = TRUE)
```

If you want to adjust settings, the functions are pipe-able. 

```{r example-adjustment}

cand |> 
  azm_fmt_batch(address, limit = 2) |> 
  azm_request_batch() |> 
  azm_extract_body(type = "viewport") |> 
  dplyr::bind_rows() |> 
  dplyr::mutate(topLeftPoint = unlist(topLeftPoint),
                btmRightPoint = unlist(btmRightPoint))

```
